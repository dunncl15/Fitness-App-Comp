## Explain who your target user is, and how the choices you’ve made solve a problem for them, address their preferences/needs, and are tailored to them.

Our target user for FitTracker is the average joe. It doesn't matter if you are a cross-fit champ or just signed up for your first 5K! Track your workouts and set your goals with FitTracker to reach your ideal you! Use FitTracker to track steps, floors, calories, workouts and active hours. Compare your daily/weekly activity to your personalized goals. 


## Wireframes (hand-drawn is fine) of your comp for mobile and desktop – we want to see your process and thinking.

## Final comps for mobile and desktop layouts built in Sketch. Button/hover/active states must be included (if and when applicable). Should be ready to hand-off to a dev team to build.

## Approach to Building the Comp
We started with mobile first working as a team then divied out the work. Made sure along the way to try and learn some new CSS tricks and concepts.
